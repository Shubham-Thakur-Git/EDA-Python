### Introduction
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a crucial step in any data analysis or machine learning project. The goal is to:
- Understand the main characteristics of the dataset.
- Identify patterns, trends, and outliers.
- Summarize the relationships between variables.
- Prepare the data for modeling by cleaning and transforming it.

This repository contains 10 Jupyter notebooks that walks through the EDA process on the Visa dataset. Key steps include data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.



### Exploratory Data Analysis

These Jupyter notebooks contains the following EDA steps:

1. **Data Loading & Overview**:
   - Importing the dataset.
   - Checking for missing values and data types.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing data.
   - Converting data types.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.).
   - Correlations between variables.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualizing distributions of individual variables (histograms, box plots).
   - Relationships between variables (scatter plots, heatmaps).

5. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Identifying and handling outliers using statistical methods and visualizations.

6. **Feature Engineering** (Optional):
   - Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve data quality.
